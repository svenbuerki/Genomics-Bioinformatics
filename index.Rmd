# Course Description, Goal, and Objectives

## Goal

The primary ***goal*** of this course is to provide students with both theoretical and applied knowledge in genomics and bioinformatics required to sequence, assemble, and annotate eukaryotic genomes [@Saitou2013; @Satam2023], with particular emphasis on non-model organisms [@Russell2017]. The overall structure of the course and progression of topics are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart).

```{r flowchart, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Overview of the structure of the course. See text for more details.", out.width = '100%', fig.pos= "h"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Flowchart_course_crop.png")
```

## Objectives

To achieve this goal, the course is designed around three core ***objectives***:

- Building strong **genomics knowledge**
- Developing practical **bioinformatics skills**
- Enhancing **scientific dissemination** abilities

Together, these objectives prepare students to engage with modern genomic research, from data generation and analysis to effective communication of results.

The first objective is to develop **genomics knowledge** through lectures that introduce foundational concepts in genome biology, sequencing technologies, and genome analysis, reinforced by applied examples that reflect real research workflows (Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart)). To provide an authentic research experience, the course draws on examples and case studies from the instructor’s research program [e.g., @Ellestad2022AJB; @Melton2021; @Melton2022].

The second objective is to develop **bioinformatics proficiency** through hands-on use of a suite of [unix-based open source software](https://opensource.com/article/18/5/differences-between-linux-and-unix) to perform genomic analyses, from raw sequence data to assembled and annotated genomes. Students will work through complete bioinformatics workflows commonly used to generate draft genome assemblies and annotations (Figure \@ref(fig:BioinfoWorkflow)). In addition to learning how to execute bioinformatics programs, students will be taught how to install and manage software, gaining critical and transferable technical expertise. Reports and supporting documents provided by the instructor will give students a structured framework for analyzing and interpreting their own genomic datasets. Computational work will be conducted on computers running the [Ubuntu Linux operating system](https://ubuntu.com/), which is widely used in genomics research. This environment will allow students to become familiar with `bash/shell`, `Python`, and `R`, and will provide an on-ramp to using research computing clusters (e.g., the [BSU Borah research cluster](https://www.boisestate.edu/rcs/2020/10/12/boise-state-university-launches-borah-a-new-peak-computing-system-for-idaho/)).

```{r BioinfoWorkflow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Overview of an example of an approach applied to produce a draft genome assembly. In this course, students will become accustomed with such approach and master some specific key steps.", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Workflow_Bioinformatics.png")
```

The third objective is to foster **scientific dissemination and critical evaluation** by engaging students in writing, presenting, and discussing scientific papers and their own genomic analyses. Through these activities, students will develop the ability to clearly communicate results and to critically assess the methodological quality, rigor, and reproducibility of published genomic studies.

---

# Course Content

Throughout the course, **bioinformatics will be used as a central conduit for studying genomics**, allowing students to explore genomic concepts through hands-on data analysis and computational workflows.

The course is subdivided into nine chapters distributed between lecture and laboratory sessions as follows (see Figure \@ref(fig:flowchart)):

**Lecture sessions:**

- **Chapter 1**: DNA and RNA.

# Bioinformatics Tools

Although we will be using software installed on the Linux computers, the instructor is advising students to install the following programs on their personal computers:

- The **R** statistical language that will allow you to gather data and analyze it.
- The **Markdown** and **LaTeX** markup languages that you can use to create documents (slideshows, articles, books, webpages) for presenting your findings.
- The *knitr* and *rmarkdown* **packages** for R and other tools, including **command-line shell programs** like GNU Make and Git version control, for dynamically tiding your data gathering, analysis, and presentation documents together so that they can be easily reproduced.
- **RStudio**, a program that brings all of these tools together in one place.

## Installing Software

As shown above, **R** and **RStudio** are at the core of this course and will have to be installed on your computers. This can be easily done by downloading the software from the following websites:

- **R**: https://www.r-project.org
- **RStudio**: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

The download pages for these software tools include detailed installation instructions; please refer to them for more information.

## Installing Markup Software

If you are planning to create LaTeX documents, you will need to install a Tex distribution. Please refer to this website for more details: https://www.latex-project.org/get/

If you want to create Markdown documents you can separately install the *rmarkdown* package in R (see [below](#Rpack) for more details).

## <a name="Rpack"></a>Installing R Packages {#Rpack}

We will be using several R packages specifically designed to support reproducible research. Many of these packages are not included in the default R installation and must be installed separately.

To install the core packages used in this course, copy the following code and paste it into your R console:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
install.packages(c("brew", "countrycode", "devtools", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "googleVis", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "tidyr", "xtable"))
```

Once you run this code, you may be prompted to select a CRAN "mirror" to download the packages from. Simply choose the mirror closest to your location.

It is also likely that we will need to install additional packages throughout the course. When that happens, you can install them using the same R function `install.packages()`, or through RStudio by selecting "Tools" → "Install Packages...", entering the package name in the dialog box, and ensuring the "Install dependencies" option is checked.

## <a name="Cheat"></a>RStudio Cheat Sheets {#Cheat}

RStudio offers a collection of cheat sheets accessible from the "Help" menu by selecting "Cheatsheets."

Five cheat sheets are especially relevant to chapters taught in this course:

  - *RStudio IDE : Cheat sheet*
  - *Data Manipulation with dplyr, tidyr*
  - *Data Visualization with ggplot2*
  - *R Markdown Cheat Sheet*
  - *R Markdown Reference Guide*

These documents together with the material presented in [course resources](#Publis) will provide the basis to design your [bioinformatics tutorials](#BioTut). 

## R Tutorials

Please find below two documents providing a comprehensive introduction to R:

- R for beginners (a tutorial by Emmanuel Paradis): https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf
- An introduction to R: https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf

# Assessments and Grading

Students will develop and demonstrate mastery of the course learning outcomes by producing written reports and delivering oral presentations, either individually or collaboratively in groups. Rather than relying on traditional exams, this course emphasizes hands-on application: you will build both theoretical genomics understanding and practical bioinformatics skills, and apply them directly to authentic research projects.  

**Graduate students:** Graduate students enrolled in this course are held to a higher standard and are expected to take on **leadership roles** during group assignments. This includes guiding discussions, coordinating group efforts, and ensuring that analyses and reports meet the advanced expectations appropriate for graduate-level work.

## Assessments

Students will be evaluated based on the following five mandatory assessments:

-  Three individual mini-reports (2 × 25 points and 1 × 50 points; **total: 100 points**).  
-  One group lab report (**150 points**).  
-  One group lab presentation (**50 points**).  

These assessments sum to a total of **300 points**. Table \@ref(tab:mygrade) shows the grading scale used in this course.

## Grading Policy 

The grading scale for this course is in Table \@ref(tab:mygrade).

```{r mygrade, echo=FALSE}
library(bookdown)
#
grades <- data.frame("Percentage" = c("100-98","97.9-93", "92.9-90", "89.9-88", "87.9-83", "82.9-80", "79.9-78", "77.9-73", "72.9-70", "69.9-68", "67.9-60", "59.9-0"), Grade = c("A+","A","A-","B+","B","B-","C+","C","C-","D+","D","F"))
knitr::kable(grades, caption = "Grading scale applied in this course.") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))
```

You can look at all of your scores by accessing Grades in the Canvas course menu. 

## Mini-Reports (TOTAL: 100 points) {#minireport}

To further develop expertise in genomics and bioinformatics, students will produce three [mini-reports](https://svenbuerki.github.io/Genomics-Bioinformatics/Mini_reports.html) that align with the course’s core learning outcomes:  

- **Mini-Report 1: Sequencing technologies** (**25 points**; related to Chapter 2)  
  - **Genomics:** Demonstrate understanding of genome sequencing principles and technologies.  
  - **Bioinformatics:** Explore how sequencing data are generated and processed.  
  - **Scientific dissemination:** Communicate technical information clearly in written form.  

- **Mini-Report 2: Molecular biology databases** (**25 points**; related to Chapter 3)  
  - **Genomics:** Explain the role of databases in genome assembly and annotation.  
  - **Bioinformatics:** Apply protocols to query and retrieve genomic data.  
  - **Scientific dissemination:** Summarize and present information from multiple sources accurately.  

- **Mini-Report 3: DNA barcoding and phylogenetic analysis** (**50 points**; related to Chapter 8)  
  - **Genomics:** Apply comparative genomics concepts to identify species and infer evolutionary relationships.  
  - **Bioinformatics:** Perform basic analyses, including sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction.  
  - **Scientific dissemination:** Integrate methods and results into a coherent written report and justify the choice of comparative articles.  

Time will be allocated during class to work on these mini-reports; however, students are expected to complete them independently outside of class.

## Group Lab Report (TOTAL: 150 points)

Students will work in groups to produce a report addressing the following research question:

> What Aquaporin genes are encoded in the sagebrush genome (*Artemisia tridentata*) and what are their functions?

To gain further insights into Aquaporins, sagebrush, and the associated bioinformatic analyses, students will read the companion publication [@Melton2021].

### Associated Scripts

Students can access `bash` and `R` scripts associated with this lab report [here](https://svenbuerki.github.io/Genomics-Bioinformatics/Mining_draft_genome.html).

### Details on Reporting

Lab reports should be formal scientific documents, structured like manuscripts with the following sections: Introduction, Materials & Methods, Results, Discussion, and References.  

- The instructor does not set a minimum word or page count but expects reports to be **concise, clear, and free of redundancy**.  
- All evidence and documentation must be provided to allow an **external reviewer to replicate analyses**. Students are expected to include associated data and code to support reproducible science; guidance on these protocols will be provided during lab sessions.  
- For group projects, each member must contribute equally. If participation is deemed insufficient, the instructor may assign individual grades.

### Alignment with Course Learning Outcomes

- **Genomics:** Apply knowledge of genome structure and gene function to identify and interpret Aquaporin genes in a non-model eukaryotic genome.  
- **Bioinformatics:** Use computational tools and scripts (`bash` and `R`) to analyze sequence data, perform gene mining, and validate results.  
- **Scientific Dissemination:** Communicate findings effectively through a structured written report, ensuring clarity, reproducibility, and proper scientific documentation.  

## Group Lab Presentation (TOTAL: 50 points)

Students will use their group lab reports to prepare **10-minute presentations**, followed by **5 minutes for questions**, scheduled during the final weeks of the semester.  

- Each student is expected to actively participate in the presentation and contribute to answering questions from the audience.  
- Presentations must be submitted in advance, either uploaded to the shared Google Drive folder or sent directly to the instructor.  

### Alignment with Course Learning Outcomes

- **Genomics:** Clearly explain the biological context, genome organization, and functional interpretation of Aquaporin genes in *Artemisia tridentata*.  
- **Bioinformatics:** Summarize the computational analyses performed, including the use of `bash` and `R` scripts, and demonstrate understanding of the bioinformatic workflow.  
- **Scientific Dissemination:** Communicate research findings effectively in an oral format, respond to questions with clarity, and demonstrate the ability to convey complex genomic and bioinformatic concepts to peers.

## Extra Credits

For students interested in earning extra credits, the instructor will provide **two opportunities** to earn a total of **30 extra credits**. Students may allocate these extra credits to any of their assessments by sending an email to the instructor specifying the allocation.  

These two non-mandatory assignments have **strict deadlines** (see [Schedule](https://svenbuerki.github.io/Genomics-Bioinformatics/Timetable.html)). **No extensions will be granted**, and any work submitted after the deadline **will not be considered**. Students who do not submit by the deadline will be deemed not interested in earning the extra credits.  

To support time management, the number of credits assigned to each question will be provided in advance. These opportunities allow students to **improve their overall grade** while gaining additional experience in genome assembly and annotation. As with other assignments, students may work in groups, but **each student must submit their own individual assignment**.

# This Class Welcomes Everyone

Students in this class represent a rich variety of backgrounds and perspectives. The (program/dept) is committed to providing an environment where similarities and differences are respected, supported, and valued.  While working together to build this community, we ask all members to:

- share their unique experiences, values, and beliefs, if comfortable doing so.
- listen deeply to one another.
- honor the uniqueness of their peers.
- appreciate the opportunity we have to learn from each other in this community.
- use this opportunity together to discuss ways in which we can create a welcoming and respectful environment in this course and across the campus community.
- recognize opportunities to invite a community member to exhibit more respectful speech or behavior—and then also invite them into further conversation. We also expect community members to respond with gratitude and to take a moment of reflection when they receive such an invitation, rather than react immediately from defensiveness.
- keep confidential any discussions that the community has of a personal (or professional) nature, unless the speaker has given explicit permission to share what they have said.

As your instructor, my goal is to make sure that our learning environment is effective for everyone. This means, in part, that each student is encouraged to share perspectives relevant to the course material and that our class activities and discussions are conducted in a way that supports everyone’s learning.

Academic Excellence is a [Shared Value](https://www.boisestate.edu/president/values/statement-of-shared-values/) at Boise State, and part of your responsibility in pursuing academic excellence includes avoiding cheating, plagiarism, and any other kind of academic misconduct. If I find a student responsible for academic misconduct in our class, the outcome of their choice to not fully engage in their learning might range from a 'revise & resubmit' up to an 'F (failure) for the course.' For more info, please read [The Student Code of Conduct (Policy 2020), Section 7: Academic Misconduct Complaints, Violations, Processes and Sanctions](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/#academic_misconduct).

## Artifical Intelligence (AI) Use in The Course

In this course, I want to see your thoughts, understand your reasoning, and hear your voice. However, there are moments in this course where you might find it useful to use generative AI tools in support of your learning.
 
You may use generative AI tools for specified activities and assignments if their use supports, rather than undermines, your learning. While generative AI can help to advance your learning, its usefulness depends on the purpose of each activity or assignment. You will find guidelines for generative AI use in the instructions for each assignment; please read them very carefully, as these guidelines differ by assignment.

If you use ChatGPT, Gemini, Grammarly, Midjourney, or other AI tools in support of your work in this course, cite any ideas, text, images, or other media generated by the tool using the instructions and format of the [Modern Language Association](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/) (MLA), [American Psychological Association](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt) (APA), [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html), or other citation style as appropriate. When you use a tool in an assignment, include a brief, clear description of how you used it. If you use generative AI, you must not let this tool replace your thinking and work. In fact, it is your responsibility to ensure you are fully engaging in learning and submitting authentic work. To learn more about how to learn successfully and avoid academic misconduct behaviors, please review the [Student Code of Conduct](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/) with special attention to [Section 8: Procedures for Academic Misconduct](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/#procedures). 

If you are unsure of whether or when to use generative AI tools in this course, please reach out to me. I am eager to learn about how we might use them in new ways to meaningfully advance your learning and prepare you for your future beyond Boise State.

## Communicable Disease Policy

Boise State has a [Communicable Disease Policy (Policy 9270)](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/facilities-planning-campus-safety/communicable-disease/#:~:text=Students%2C%20faculty%2C%20and%20other%20employees,to%20the%20Public%20Health%20Office.) that guides everyone working and learning in our community. The policy has two key implications:

1.	Any illness covered by the policy must be reported to Boise State Public Health by the impacted individual,
2.	Faculty are required to accommodate any student impacted by any illness covered by the policy as directed by Boise State Public Health. 

## Late Work Policy

Due dates for all assignments are provided on the course [schedule](https://svenbuerki.github.io/Genomics-Bioinformatics/Timetable.html). Unless otherwise stated, assignments are **due on those dates**.  

The instructor recognizes that unforeseen circumstances may arise. If this happens, please contact the instructor **ahead of the due date**, or **as soon as possible afterwards**, so that we can establish a plan for submitting the assignment as close to the original due date as possible.  

**Automatic Late Penalty:**

- If a student fails to submit an assignment by the due date **without a valid excuse**, a **10% penalty** will be applied to the assignment grade.  
- In such cases, the instructor will reach out to the student to establish a **new submission deadline** and clarify expectations for completing the assignment.  

Assignments that are not submitted within **two weeks of the due date** and for which the student has not communicated with the instructor will be recorded as **Incomplete** in Canvas until a plan is agreed upon.

# Note on Course Content and Idaho Law

Under Idaho law (Section § 67-5909D), some university courses with content related to diversity, equity, inclusion, or critical theory may be subject to certain restrictions. However, the law affirms and does not limit free discussion in the learning environment. Like all Boise State courses, this course supports open inquiry, intellectual honesty, and respectful engagement with a range of perspectives, all of which are consistent with student rights and responsibilities described in the [Student Code of Conduct (Policy 2020)](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/student-affairs/code-of-conduct/). 

This course may include content that touches on concepts related to diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), or critical theory—such as systemic inequality, cultural identity, or gender and race in society. If these topics are included, it is because they are relevant to the learning outcomes for this course and are explored to support critical thinking, deeper understanding, and respectful engagement with different perspectives. As part of the course, you may be asked to apply or explain ideas that come from a particular perspective. However, you are not required to adopt such perspectives as your own.

Our learning environment is a space for open dialogue and thoughtful discussion, including complex or challenging topics. Everyone is expected to engage with curiosity, listen respectfully, and contribute in ways that support a productive and welcoming learning environment. Boise State and the Idaho State Board of Education affirm the importance of free expression and academic inquiry. As outlined in SBOE Policy III.B:

> “Membership in the academic community imposes on administrators, faculty members, other institutional employees, and students an obligation to respect the dignity of others, to acknowledge the right of others to express differing opinions, and to foster and defend intellectual honesty, freedom of inquiry and instruction, and free expression on and off the campus of an institution.”

Disruptive behavior that interferes with the learning environment will not be tolerated and may result in removal from this course, in line with university policy (See [Policy 3240 Maintaining Effective Learning Environments](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/academic-affairs-student/maintaining-effective-learning-environments/)).

In this course, I will foster critical discussion and analysis, and a respectful consideration of a wide range of ideas, in accordance with the [Faculty Code of Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct (Policy 4000)](https://www.boisestate.edu/policy/academic-affairs-faculty-administration/faculty-code-of-rights-responsibilities-and-conduct/). You are encouraged to think critically, question ideas, and form your own conclusions. As always, you have the freedom to choose courses that align with your academic goals—if you have concerns about course content, please talk with your instructor or advisor. Refer to the academic calendar for important deadlines related to course withdrawal.

To learn more about the law and its impact at Boise State, visit the [Provost Office’s Information Regarding Section 67-5909D page](https://www.boisestate.edu/academics/information-regarding-section-67-5909d-course-and-curriculum/).
