Term,Definition
Genomics,"The study of genomes, the complete set of genetic material within an organism (i.e. nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplastic genomes). Genomics uses an approach combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics to assemble and annotate entire genomes. "
Genome,"A genome is the entire genetic complement of a living organism. Each organism possesses a genome containing the biological information needed to construct and maintain a living example of that organism. Most genomes are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), but few viruses have RNA (ribonucleic acid) genomes."
DNA,Deoxyribonucleic acid.
RNA,Ribonucleic acid.
Genetic code ,The genetic code specifies how the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA is translated into the amino acid (AA) sequence of a protein. Different genetic codes depending on lineages. 20 amino acids: high redundancy (except Met & Trp). Start codon: Met (sometimes Trp in cpDNA).
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS),"Next-Generation Sequncing (NGS) is the term applied to methods enabling thousands of millions of DNA fragments to be sequenced in parallel in a single experiment. NGS outperformed Sanger sequencing, which was able to sequence only individual DNA fragments, each fragment obtained by a different PCR."
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)," Method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail."
Amino acid (AA),One of the constituents of proteins; proteins are polymers of amino acids.
Bioinformatics,The use of computer methods in studies of genomes.
