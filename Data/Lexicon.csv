Term,Definition
Genomics,"The study of genomes, the complete set of genetic material within an organism (i.e. nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplastic genomes). Genomics uses an approach combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics to assemble and annotate entire genomes. "
Genome,"A genome is the entire genetic complement of a living organism. Each organism possesses a genome containing the biological information needed to construct and maintain a living example of that organism. Most genomes are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), but few viruses have RNA (ribonucleic acid) genomes."
DNA,Deoxyribonucleic acid.
RNA,Ribonucleic acid.
Genetic code ,The genetic code specifies how the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA is translated into the amino acid (AA) sequence of a protein. Different genetic codes depending on lineages. 20 amino acids: high redundancy (except Met & Trp). Start codon: Met (sometimes Trp in cpDNA).
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS),"Next-Generation Sequncing (NGS) is the term applied to methods enabling thousands of millions of DNA fragments to be sequenced in parallel in a single experiment. NGS outperformed Sanger sequencing, which was able to sequence only individual DNA fragments, each fragment obtained by a different PCR."
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)," Method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail."
Amino acid (AA),One of the constituents of proteins; proteins are polymers of amino acids.
Bioinformatics,The use of computer methods in studies of genomes.
Whole-genome sequencing (WGS),The process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time.
Targeted re-sequencing,"Sequencing of selected regions of a genome; for instance, a subset of genes (using either baits or amplicons). This approach is now commonly applied for phylogenetic inferences. "
Exome sequencing,Sequencing only the portions of a genome corresponding to expressed proteins.
RNA-Seq,"Sequencing RNAs in a sample. RNA sequencing is carried out by reverse transcribing the RNAs, and sequencing the complementary DNA (cDNA)."
Single-end sequencing,Technique in which sequence is reported from only one end of a fragment.
Paired-end sequencing,Technique in which sequence is reported from both ends of a fragment (with a number of undetermined bases between the reads that is known only approximately).
Mate pair sequencing,"Technique in which sequence is reported from two ends of a DNA fragment, usually several thousand base-pairs long."
Phred quality score,Measure of the quality of the identification of the nucleobases generated by automated DNA sequencing.
Holoploid 1C-value (abbreviated to 1C-value),"This term refers to the
amount of DNA in the unreplicated gametic nucleus (e.g.,
pollen or egg cell of angiosperms) regardless of the ploidy
level of the cell."
Synteny,Conservation of blocks of genes/DNA between two or more sets of chromosomes belonging to different species.
N50,Measure to describe the quality of assembled genomes that are fragmented in contigs/scaffolds of different length. The N50 is defined as the minimum contig/scaffold length needed to cover 50% of the genome. 
Orthologous genes,Genes diverging after evolution gives rise to different species (i.e. they follow speciation events).
"Umami, or savory taste","One of the five basic tastes, which has been described as brothy or meaty and is associated with glutamate."
