Term,Definition
Alternative splicing,"Cellular process in which exons from the same gene are joined in different combinations, leading to different, but related, mRNA transcripts. These mRNAs can be translated to produce different proteins with distinct structures and functions — all from a single gene."
Amino acid (AA),One of the constituents of proteins; proteins are polymers of amino acids.
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC),"A BAC is an engineered DNA molecule used to clone DNA sequences in bacterial cells (for example, E. coli). BACs are often used in connection with DNA sequencing. Segments of an organism's DNA, ranging from 100,000 to about 300,000 base pairs, can be inserted into BACs. The BACs, with their inserted DNA, are then taken up by bacterial cells. As the bacterial cells grow and divide, they amplify the BAC DNA, which can then be isolated and used in sequencing DNA."
Bioinformatics,The use of computer methods in studies of genomes.
BLAST,"The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool uses a query sequence and large database to find regions of local similarity between sequences. The
program is at the heart of the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s sequence search engine, compares nucleotide or protein sequences to the
ever-growing sequence databases and estimates the statistical significance of matches."
Clade,"This term refers to a monophyletic (natural) group, namely a hypothetical common ancestor and all its descendants, as identified by uniquely derived
and unreversed synapomorphies. A clade is visualized on a cladogram as a node and all its subtended terminals."
Cluster,"A group of individuals or genes visualized as terminals on a tree or dendrogram and used in place of “clade” whenever analyses are conducted
below the species level. A group of organisms is said to cluster in an analysis when they share an exclusive node. Because clustering algorithms may be
applied below the species level where relationships are not strictly nested, clusters are not monophyletic in the strict sense, only a graphic one. Cluster is also
a term used to define closely related organisms in principal components analysis or STRUCTURE."
Complementary DNA sequence,"Nucleic acid sequence of bases that can form a double- stranded structure by matching base pairs. For example, the complementary sequence to C-A-T-G (where each letter stands for one of the bases in DNA) is G-T-A-C."
Cryptic species,"Difficult to detect and, in reference to species, referring to difficulty in diagnosing or recognizing morphologically
indistinguishable species without DNA barcode data. One of the explicitly targeted applications of DNA barcoding is that of detecting cryptic species."
Contig,A contiguous sequence of bases. Also see Unitig.
Unitig,A type of contig for which there are no competing choices in terms of internal overlaps (they usually stop before a repeat sequence).
Distance/similarity (Genetic),"A phenetic measure of comparison which represents the overall similarity of two organisms. Operationally, a pairwise measure
generated from sequence data, most commonly via the Kimura two parameter (K2P) model which specifies probabilities of different kinds of character state
(base pair) change. The lack of equiprobability is used to correct the distance measure for rate heterogeneity of sequence change."
DNA,Deoxyribonucleic acid.
DNA barcoding,"This is a method of species identification using a short section of DNA from a specific gene or genes. The premise of DNA barcoding is that by comparison with a reference library of such DNA sections (also called ""sequences""), an individual sequence can be used to uniquely identify an organism to species, just as a supermarket scanner uses the familiar black stripes of the UPC barcode to identify an item in its stock against its reference database. These ""barcodes"" are sometimes used in an effort to identify unknown species or parts of an organism, simply to catalog as many taxa as possible, or to compare with traditional taxonomy in an effort to determine species boundaries."
Exome,"The exome is composed of all of the exons within the genome, the sequences which, when transcribed, remain within the mature RNA after introns are removed by RNA splicing. This includes untranslated regions of messenger RNA, and coding regions."
Exome sequencing,"Exome sequencing is the targeted enrichment and sequencing of the whole exome. Exome sequencing is the most powerful tool available for the identification of genetic variations associated with a phenotype, such as a disease."
Genetic code ,The genetic code specifies how the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA is translated into the amino acid (AA) sequence of a protein. Different genetic codes depending on lineages. 20 amino acids: high redundancy (except Met & Trp). Start codon: Met (sometimes Trp in cpDNA).
Genome,"A genome is the entire genetic complement of a living organism. Each organism possesses a genome containing the biological information needed to construct and maintain a living example of that organism. Most genomes are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), but few viruses have RNA (ribonucleic acid) genomes."
Genomics,"The study of genomes, the complete set of genetic material within an organism (i.e. nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplastic genomes). Genomics uses an approach combining next-generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatics to assemble and annotate entire genomes. "
Heterozygosity,The condition of having two different alleles at a locus.
Heterozygote,A diploid organism that carries two different versions of a specific gene.
High molecular weight DNA,High molecular weight DNA corresponds to DNA fragments between 100-300kb in length
Holoploid 1C-value (abbreviated to 1C-value),"This term refers to the
amount of DNA in the unreplicated gametic nucleus (e.g.,
pollen or egg cell of angiosperms) regardless of the ploidy
level of the cell."
k-mer,"In bioinformatics, k-mers are subsequences of length k contained within a biological sequence. "
Mate pair sequencing,"Technique in which sequence is reported from two ends of a DNA fragment, usually several thousand base-pairs long."
Maximum Likelihood (ML),"A class of parameterized tree-building approaches that incorporates probabilities of character state change based on
frequentist statistics among different classes of character data (e.g., transitions vs. transversions, codon positions, etc.). The likelihood of the data given a
tree and a model is computed to find an optimal tree for a dataset."
Monoisolate,"a single animal, cultured cell-line, inbred population,.or possibly a heterogeneous population when a single genome assembly is generated from a pooled sample because multiple individuals are needed to collect enough material and an inbred line is not available; however, this situation is not preferred."
Monophyly,"In cladistics for a group of organisms, monophyly is the condition of being a clade—that is, a group of taxa composed only of a common ancestor and all of its lineal descendants."
N50,Measure to describe the quality of assembled genomes that are fragmented in contigs/scaffolds of different length. The N50 is defined as the minimum contig/scaffold length needed to cover 50% of the genome. 
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS),"Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is the term applied to methods enabling thousands of millions of DNA fragments to be sequenced in parallel in a single experiment. NGS outperformed Sanger sequencing, which was able to sequence only individual DNA fragments, each fragment obtained by a different PCR."
Open Reading Frame (ORF) ,"In molecular genetics, an open reading frame (ORF) is the part of a reading frame that has the ability to be translated. An ORF is a continuous stretch of codons that begins with a start codon (usually AUG) and ends at a stop codon (usually UAA, UAG or UGA)."
Orthologous genes,Genes diverging after evolution gives rise to different species (i.e. they follow speciation events).
Paired-end sequencing,Technique in which sequence is reported from both ends of a fragment (with a number of undetermined bases between the reads that is known only approximately).
Paralogue,"Genes or proteines with similar sequences, but different (although possibly related) functions, arising from a common ancestral gene."
Phred quality score,Measure of the quality of the identification of the nucleobases generated by automated DNA sequencing.
Phylogenetic species concept,"The concept of a species as an irreducible group whose members are descended from a common ancestor and who all possess a combination of certain defining, or derived, traits. Hence, this concept defines a species as a group having a shared and unique evolutionary history."
Phylogenetic support,"The strength of inference for nodes in a phylogenetic tree are assessed using support measures. Higher the support measures
connote greater reliability for a given hypothesized relationship. Bremer support (maximum parsimony based), bootstrap (distance, parsimony, likelihood) and
Bayesian posteriors are all different kinds of support measures used in phylogenetic analysis."
Phylogenetic tree,"Any bifurcating graphic or dendrogram intended to summarize comparative data and interpreted to reflect common ancestry. Since
“tree” refers to the graphic, it is not strictly synonymous with “phylogeny” but may be treated equivalently under the explicit assumptions of an underlying
nested hierarchy generated by descent with modification. Trees based on recombinant elements of individual conspecific organisms may violate these
assumptions but are still be used as provisional tools for approximating species boundaries. Phylogenetic trees can be generated using any number of
methods as described above; the term “clade” is properly used with reference to derived or diagnostic characters and thus “cladogram” is generally reserved
for trees generated under parsimony."
Plesiomorphic,"A primitive or ancestral character state is called plesiomorphy (plesiomorphic character), and a shared plesiomorphy is called a symplesiomorphy. For example, hair is a unique mammalian character that evolved with the evolution of mammals."
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)," Method widely used to rapidly make millions to billions of copies of a specific DNA sample, allowing scientists to take a very small sample of DNA and amplify it to a large enough amount to study in detail."
Promoter,Promoter sequences are DNA sequences that define where transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase begins. Promoter sequences are typically located directly upstream or at the 5' end of the transcription initiation site.
Read trimming,"Sequencing data is often provided as raw reads which are processed prior to analysis 1 of the most used preprocessing procedures is read trimming, which aims at removing low quality portions while preserving the longest high quality part of a NGS read."
Reverse DNA sequence,It is the sequence of the upper strand in the direction from its 3′- to its 5′-end. The reverse complement sequence is the sequence of the lower strand in the direction of its 5′- to its 3′-end.
RNA,Ribonucleic acid.
RNA editing,"This is a molecular process through which some cells can make discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences within an RNA molecule after it has been generated by RNA polymerase. It occurs in all living organisms and is one of the most evolutionarily conserved properties of RNAs. The most common form of RNA editing in human cells is adenosine to inosine (A-to-I), which is mediated by “adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs)” editing enzymes. As I is recognized as guanine (G) by translation machines, it is also called the A-to-G variate type."
RNA-Seq,"Sequencing RNAs in a sample. RNA sequencing is carried out by reverse transcribing the RNAs, and sequencing the complementary DNA (cDNA)."
Single-end sequencing,Technique in which sequence is reported from only one end of a fragment.
Scaffold,A sequence of contigs separated by gaps (Ns).
Species circumscription/delimitation/delineation,"The iterative process of collating potentially diagnostic character data to proscribe observational
boundaries between two or more species. Species delimitation methods are broad and require a criterion specified a priori. Delimitation is
used interchangeably with delineation, circumscription and demarcation."
Specimen identification/determination,"The process of using morphological or molecular diagnostics or other organismal attributes to assign biological
specimens taxonomic names. Not to be confused with species delimitation or discovery."
Synteny,Conservation of blocks of genes/DNA between two or more sets of chromosomes belonging to different species.
Targeted re-sequencing,"Sequencing of selected regions of a genome; for instance, a subset of genes (using either baits or amplicons). This approach is now commonly applied for phylogenetic inferences. "

Whole-genome sequencing (WGS),The process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome at a single time.
Ploidy,"The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell, or in the cells of an organism. Types of ploidy levels: (i) Haploid: One complete set of chromosomes (e.g., human sperm/egg); (ii) Diploid: Two complete sets, one from each parent (e.g., most human somatic cells with 23 pairs); (iii) Polyploid: Three or more sets of chromosomes (e.g., triploid, tetraploid); (iv) Aneuploid: An abnormal number of chromosomes, not a complete set (e.g., Down syndrome). "
Genome size,"The total amount of DNA contained within one copy of a single complete genome. It is typically measured in terms of mass in picograms (trillionths or 10−12 of a gram, abbreviated pg) or as the total number of nucleotide base pairs, usually in megabases (millions of base pairs, abbreviated Mb or Mbp). One picogram is equal to 978 megabases. In diploid organisms, genome size is often used interchangeably with the term C-value."
