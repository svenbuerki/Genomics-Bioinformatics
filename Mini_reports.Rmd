# Introduction

To further gain expertise in the field of genomics, students are producing three mini-reports on the following topics:

- [**Mini-Report 1**](#mini1): Sequencing technologies (25 points; this task is related to Chapter 2).
- **Mini-Report 2**: Molecular biology databases (25 points; this task is related to Chapter 3).
- **Mini-Report 3**: Use knowledge from the previous mini-reports to review plant genomes available on GenBank database (50 points). Here, we will be using `R` to mine and analyze data.

Time will be allocated in class to work on these mini-reports, but the instructor expects students to complete those on their own time.

# Mini-report 1 -- Sequencing platforms & technologies {#mini1}

To have a full overview of available sequencing platforms, students are tasked to produce individual mini-reports on the following sequencing platforms and their associated technologies:

- **Sequencing platform 1:** Illumina.
- **Sequencing platform 2:** PacBio.
- **Sequencing platform 3:** Oxford Nanopore.

## Background information

Each student was assigned a sequencing platform to work on (please see [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cRM1yasUfDa98ecyz_-RxUOw8cU4wkQx4O5Wxw3y4yU/edit?usp=sharing) for more information). 

The assignment is mandatory and will be graded. Please see this task as an opportunity to consolidate your knowledge on next-generation sequencing technologies and writing scientific reports.   

Time will be allocated in class on the 27th of January 2021 to allow students to work on their assignments. Reports are due on **the 5th of February 2021** and should be uploaded on the shared [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BFZFJeR8tW8N7QLfngqIVbjqEkDuIyWj?usp=sharing) in the `Mini_Reports` folder.


## Structure of mini-reports {#structure}

Please structure your reports to ensure covering the following aspects:

- Introduce the sequencing technology (incl. library preparation and DNA requirements).
- Provide an overview of available sequencing systems.
- Outline the research potential/applicability of the sequencing platform. 
- Provide any additional information such as e.g. price, accessibility, technical support, that you feel are relevant to your sequencing platform. 

## Reporting format

Maximum two pages, single spaced, using either Arial 11 pt or Times New Roman 12 pt and with all margins set to 1 inch. The two pages do not include a title page and references. The title page should include: name of the sequencing platform as title and name of student contributing the report. Please keep in mind that a figure can convey a lot more information than a long text! Your reports should follow the structure presented in section \@ref(structure). 

Upload your reports on the shared Google drive by the 5th of February before 5 pm. Name your report documents following this pattern: `Sequencing platform_Surname`.

## Resources

The instructor has provided `pdf` documents devoted to each sequencing platform provided below to support students in starting their assignments. 

In addition, please use information available from manufacturers' websites, publications, online NGS training sites (e.g. EMBL-EBI Training), Google, YouTube and Wikipedia to prepare your reports and presentations. Do not forget to provide citations supporting your claims in your reports. I let you decide which reference style you want to use (look at your favorite journals for examples).
